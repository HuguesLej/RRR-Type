# Windows Installation Guide

This document provides instructions on how to install, clean, or uninstall the R-Type project on Windows systems.

The project includes Batch scripts to simplify installation, compilation, and uninstallation. The installation script manages required dependencies and compiles the project for you, eliminating the need for manual package installation in most cases.

**Supported platforms:** Windows 10 and later.

If the scripts do not work in your environment, or if you prefer to handle the project manually, you can follow the instructions to install without scripts.
