# Package Manager and vcpkg

This document aims to provide an overview of the benefits of using a package manager in the project development, with a specific focus on vcpkg. It highlights the advantages of vcpkg over other package managers and explains why it has been the preferred choice for managing dependencies in the project.

## Why Use a Package Manager?

Using a package manager offers several benefits:

1. **Dependency Management**: Automatically handle dependencies, ensuring that all required libraries and tools are installed.
2. **Version Control**: Easily manage and switch between different versions of libraries.
3. **Consistency**: Ensure that all team members are using the same versions of dependencies, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
4. **Efficiency**: Save time by automating the installation and configuration of dependencies.
5. **Security**: Quickly apply updates and patches to dependencies, improving the security of projects.

## Why vcpkg?

### vcpkg Advantages

Here are some reasons to use vcpkg:

1. **Ease of Use**: vcpkg is designed to be simple to use, with straightforward commands for installing and managing packages.
2. **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it versatile for different development environments.
3. **Integration with CMake**: vcpkg integrates well with CMake, simplifying the process of adding dependencies to C++ projects.
4. **Large Repository**: Offers a wide range of libraries and tools, ensuring that needed packages can be found.
5. **Active Development**: Continuously updated and maintained by Microsoft and the open-source community, ensuring it stays current with the latest libraries and tools.

### Why vcpkg rather than other package managers ?

Using vcpkg over other package managers like CMP or Conan can be advantageous for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: vcpkg is designed to be straightforward and easy to use, making it accessible even for developers who are new to package management.
2. **Consistent Experience**: vcpkg offers a consistent experience across different platforms and development environments, reducing the learning curve.
3. **CMake Integration**: vcpkg offers seamless integration with CMake, making it easier to manage dependencies directly within CMake projects.
4. **Microsoft Support**: As a Microsoft project, vcpkg benefits from strong support and continuous updates from Microsoft, ensuring it remains reliable and up-to-date.
5. **Focus on C++**: vcpkg is specifically tailored for C++ development, providing a curated set of libraries and tools that are commonly used in C++ projects.
6. **Build Efficiency**: Unlike CMP, which downloads source files and requires compilation, vcpkg provides pre-built binaries, reducing build times and simplifying dependency management.
7. **Ease of Use on Windows**: While Conan can be complex and challenging to use, especially on Windows, vcpkg offers a more straightforward and user-friendly experience.
