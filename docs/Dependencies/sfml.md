# SFML Dependency

This document aims to provide an overview of the benefits of using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) C++ graphic library in the project development.


## Why Use SFML

SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is a powerful and easy-to-use library that provides a simple interface to various multimedia components in C++. Here are some reasons to use SFML:

- **Ease of Use**: SFML is designed to be easy to use, with a straightforward API that makes it simple to create windows, draw graphics, handle events, and manage multimedia resources.
- **Cross-Platform**: SFML supports multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, allowing you to write code once and run it anywhere.
- **Modular Design**: SFML is divided into several modules (system, window, graphics, audio, and network), so you can use only the parts you need for your project.
- **Active Community**: SFML has an active and supportive community, with plenty of tutorials, documentation, and forums to help you get started and solve any issues you encounter.
- **Performance**: SFML is designed to be efficient and fast, making it suitable for real-time applications like games and interactive simulations.

By leveraging SFML, you can focus on developing your application logic without worrying about the underlying multimedia complexities.
